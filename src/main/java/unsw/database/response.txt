Assumption:
-Assume that once the database is created, the database structure from that point will remain the same.
-Assume there won't be duplicates in a given row
-Any columns that aren't specified are presumed to have the value "" for text and 0 for marks
-Assume won't be given dependencies such that A depends on B and B depends on A.

A listener should be attached to every row, to the derived columns.

This way if a change is made to a row, that field in the particular row can automatically update their value
